# Introduction to Drizzle ORM, Next.js 14, and Clerk

When developing a web application with **Next.js**, leveraging robust tools and services can significantly streamline the development process. **[Clerk](https://clerk.com) stands out as a comprehensive authentication solution designed to simplify user management, offering a wide range of authentication methods** and features with minimal setup. On the other hand, [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/get-started-postgresql#neon) is an emerging Object-Relational Mapping tool that promises a smooth database interaction experience, enabling developers to write more intuitive and maintainable database queries. Pairing these with **[Neon](https://neon.tech/), a PostgreSQL-compatible database that offers scalability and ease of management**, sets a strong foundation for building scalable, secure, and efficient web applications. {{ className: "lead" }}

## Authentication with Clerk - first steps

As the first step please visit [Clerk](https://clerk.com) and create an account. After you have created an account and the create a new application also pre-selecting the authentication service (you will be able to change this later).

As the next step, go to your app folder and create **.env.local** file and add the keys provided by Clerk.

![Clerk_03](/drizzle-nextjs/03_Clerk.png)

**Step 1** - Install Clerk.js for Next.js

```bash
npm install @clerk/nextjs
```

**Step 2** - Set your environment variables (it should be already done, as when you created the app, you have received the keys)

**Step 3** - Add ClerkProvider inside your **layout.tsx** file.

```tsx
import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'

import type { Metadata } from 'next'
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google'
import './globals.css'

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] })

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'Create Next App',
  description: 'Generated by create next app',
}

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode
}>) {
  return (
    <ClerkProvider>
      <html lang="en">
        <body className={inter.className}>{children}</body>
      </html>
    </ClerkProvider>
  )
}
```

**Step 4** - Update your **middleware.ts** file

Update your middleware file or create one at the root of your project or src/ directory if you're using a src/ directory structure.

The authMiddleware helper enables authentication and is where you'll configure your protected routes.

**/middleware.ts**

Setting **"/"** as a public route will allow users to access the homepage without being authenticated. You can add more routes to the publicRoutes array as needed.

```tsx
import { authMiddleware } from '@clerk/nextjs'

export default authMiddleware({
  publicRoutes: ['/'],
})

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/((?!.+.[w]+$|_next).*)', '/', '/(api|trpc)(.*)'],
}
```

**And voila!** You have set up the Clerk authentication service within your Next.js app.

In order to test it, you quickly create a new folder **News** and **page.tsx** file within it.
And now **if you would like to access your localhost:3000/news you should be redirected to the Clerk login page.**

## Additional Clerk features (latest updates)

### ClerkLoading

Let's add a little spinner for the loading state of the Clerk authentication service.

```tsx
import { ClerkLoading } from '@clerk/nextjs'
import { Loader } from 'lucide-react'

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main>
      Hello, we will be testing Clerk latest update and Drizzle ORM.
      <div>
        <ClerkLoading>
          <Loader className="text-muted-foreground h-5 w-5" />
        </ClerkLoading>
      </div>
    </main>
  )
}
```

### ClerkLoaded, SignedIn, SignedOut, SignInButton, UserButton

Below you will find an example of how to use ClerkLoaded, SignedIn, SignedOut, SignInButton, and UserButton components. As the latest developments in Clerk.

```tsx
import {
  ClerkLoading,
  ClerkLoaded,
  SignedIn,
  SignedOut,
  UserButton,
  SignInButton,
} from '@clerk/nextjs'

import { Loader } from 'lucide-react'

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main>
      Hello, we will be testing Clerk latest update and Drizzle ORM.
      <div className="flex flex-col">
        <ClerkLoading>
          <Loader className="text-muted-foreground h-5 w-5" />
        </ClerkLoading>

        <ClerkLoaded>
          <SignedIn>
            <UserButton afterSignOutUrl="/" />
          </SignedIn>
          <SignedOut>
            <SignInButton
              mode="modal"
              afterSignInUrl="/News"
              afterSignUpUrl="/News"
            >
              <button className="w-fit rounded-lg bg-blue-500 p-4 text-white">
                Sign In
              </button>
            </SignInButton>
          </SignedOut>
        </ClerkLoaded>
      </div>
    </main>
  )
}
```

[Here is the guide for further developments](https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/custom-signup-signin-pages)

## Time for Drizzle ORM with Neon

[Neon](https://neon.tech/) describes itself as **"The fully managed serverless Postgres with a generous free tier. We separate storage and compute to offer autoscaling, branching, and bottomless storage."**

When you create an account, you will be able to create a new database and get the connection string that looks like this:

```bash
postgresql://neondb_owner:************@ep-calm-......
```

Add the connection string to your **.env.local** file.

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:************@ep-calm-......
```

This is pretty much it for Neon setup. Now let's move to the Drizzle ORM setup.

### Drizzle ORM setup

Head to [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/get-started-postgresql#neon) and follow the steps.

**Step 1** - Install Drizzle ORM

```bash
npm i drizzle-orm @neondatabase/serverless
npm i -D drizzle-kit
```

**Step 2** - Create a new folder named **database** in your root directory and create a new file **drizzle.ts**.

```ts
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless'
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/neon-http'

import * as schema from './schema'

const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL!)

const db = drizzle(sql, { schema })

export default db
```

**Step 3** - Create **the schema** within the **database** folder.

```ts
import { pgTable, serial, text } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core'

export const courses = pgTable('courses', {
  id: serial('id').primaryKey(),
  title: text('title').notNull(),
  imageSrc: text('image_src').notNull(),
})
```

**Step 4** - In the root of your app, please create **drizzle.config.ts** file. Also let's install the **dotenv** package.

```bash
npm i dotenv
```

```ts
import 'dotenv/config'
import type { Config } from 'drizzle-kit'

export default {
  schema: './database/schema.ts',
  out: './drizzle',
  driver: 'pg',
  dbCredentials: {
    connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL!,
  },
} satisfies Config
```

**Step 5** (optional) - Add the following script to your **package.json** file.

```json
"scripts": {
    "db:studio": "npx drizzle-kit studio",
    "db:push": "npx drizzle-kit push:pg",
}
```

**Step 6** - Run the following command to create the database schema.

```bash
npm run db:push
```

and voila! You have set up the Drizzle ORM with Neon. You can now start creating your models and queries also go and check **the studio**.

```bash
npm run db:studio
```

you may need to install **pg** package for this:

```bash
npm i -D pg
```
