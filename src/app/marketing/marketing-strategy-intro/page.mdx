# Marketing Strategy

Marketing Strategy involves planning and decision-making over the long-term with the aim of establishing a **sustainable competitive advantage.** {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>
  Successful firms tend to be **market-driven and externally focused.** They establish a direction with clear objectives and conduct internal and external analysis in support of their marketing strategy.
</Note>

Short-term planning is generally not considered a characteristic of a company's marketing strategy. Nor is **tactical marketing**, but, of course, strategic marketing should always precede and inform tactical marketing. {{ className: 'lead' }}

Most firms today are concerned with effective marketing strategy development over a period of ranging from two to five years or longer. Some UK insurance companies, for example, are preparing 10-year strategic marketing plans, recognising that it will take them time to adapt to changes in technologies taht will have a profound impact on insurance offerings.

Some electrical utility companies are concerned about effective marketing strategies for the next five years, while on the other hand, some companies making smartphones are more concerned about the next six months to a year.

**Effective marketing strategies** also involve understanding the interactions of individual elements to maximise effectiveness. For example, many automobile companies are adopting a market-driven approach to focus on eco-friendly vehicles.
Over the past several years, Tesla has been successul in introducing electric vehicles to the mass market and disrupting the traditional automotive industry.

<Note>
Ultimately, firms need to be externally focused, market-driven and have a long-term perspective to create and implement effective marketing strategies that give them a sustainable competitive advantage. It is therefore vitally important to understand and appreciate both the emphasis and scope of marketing strategy and its comparable term - strategic marketing.

## Marketing Strategy framework

When asked to describe or characterise the marketing strategy, or to indicate its contents when developing one, it is tempting to simply refer to the marketing mix elements (product, price, place, promotion).

After all, such elements are basic building blocks referred to in marketing.
A major imitation of this narrow characterisation, however, is that characterising a marketing strategy in terms of these elements alone, neglects a great deal that is vitally important to ensuring marketing strategy success.

By referring only to marketing mix, there is nothing said about the target audience and, even, the market entry timing strategy.
**For these and other reasons, in this module, we adopt the perspective that a marketing strategy is actually a set of strategic decisions about:**

- where to compete
- how to compete

where each of these decisions involves more specific decisions.

## Importance of Marketing Strategy

In the context of modern business, having a marketing strategy is crucial for the survival and success of a company. Different companies have different reasons for prioritizing marketing stratgies, but it typically boils down to providing direction and focus, establishing a competitive advantage, or surviving in a turbulent enviornment. For example, Ryanair has succeded in offering rock-bottom airfares due to its relentless pursuit of cost advantages, while other companies, such as many automobile manufacturers, need to keep adapting their marketing strategies to stay afloat in a changing market.
Even with these varying motivations, one thing remains clear:

Have a well-defined and carefully pursued marketing strategy can be the key to company's success. Ultimately, a strong marketing strategy can provide a roadmap for companies to achieve their goals and navigate the challenges of an ever-changing business landscape.

## Marketing Strategy Trends

Marketing Strategy itself is **dynamic and subject** to certain trends. This is driven not only by ongoing research in the field but also, of course, by ongoing developments in marketing strategy practices. Keep in mind therefore that, moving ahead, we should develop and apply our knowledge of marketing strategy in ways that are consistent with trends that we see in the field and where such trends include the following:

- being increasingly proactive rather than reactive
- being increasingly externally focused by adopting an even stronger market orientation
- increasingly relying on robust information systems and particularly systems that make use of **Artificial Intelligence**
- striving for increasingly longer time horizons for marketing strategy planning and preparation
- **taking even greater advantage of empirical research to complement and supplement theoretical research**

<Note>
The far-reaching scope of marketing strategy means that it has a tremendous influence on company strategy as well.

<Note>
Over time, the paradigm of marketing strategy has shifted from an operational focus to developing and pursuing long-term sustainable competitive advantage.

<Note>
Rather than focusing simply on marketing outcomes, we must appreciate they go hand-in-hand with the planning process and so both should be given equal weighting on our organisations to increase the likelihood of future marketing strategy successes.
