# Strategic Brand Decisions

The set reading will expound further on the key decisions involved in branding a product:

- to brand the product or not
- the choice of sponsor for the brand
- the branding strategy and repositioning issues

## Why brands are important

Brands are not merely differentiation 'marks'. They trigger specific responses in the minds of consumers. For example, responses could be **aspirational** (I aspire to eventually own this brand of car), **expressive** (Wearing this brand of shoes lets me express the real me), **imaginative** (when I wear this brand of sunglesses, I imagine that I am a world traveller), or **associative** (I think of the tropics whenever I drink this brand of juice). These differentiate the brand from the unbranded product. Products can be copied by competitors, a brand is unique.
A product can become obsolete quickly, a successful brand, properly managed, can be timeless.
Many successful brands - for example, Bovril, Quaker, Vaseline, Coca-Cola, and Oxo have been in existence for decades.

Brands, through a strategy of careful management, skillful promotion, and continual investment, come to represent a specific set of values and attributes, both tangible and intangible, in the minds of consumers.
It is these values and brand attributes that differentiate a firm's product from those offered by competitors, and which determine consumer preference and loyalty.

Brands are worth building because when something on offer is not a brand, it will probably be a commodity for which price is the only thing that counts. In such circumstances, **the only winner is the lowest-cost producer.**
Studies show that brands are worth developing and protecting because they generate value for their owners. Typially, a strong brand obtains a price premium and achieves a high market share: customers want to buy them and are willing to pay more for the product. Strong brands are also more profitable. **A well-known PIMS study found that brands with a market share of 40% generate three times the return on investment of those with a market share of only 10% (Buzzell and Gale, 1987).**

Another PIMS study, comparing 500 US and European fast-moving consumer goods companies across more than 200 business measurements over four years, found that brands with the highest market share will always generate better profits than brands with the second and third highest market shares, no matter what their advertising expenditures.

If the brand leaders spends less than 50% of its budget on media, it will earn, on average, a 39% return on capital employed over four years, whereas a spend of 70% or more on advertising sees return rise, albeit to only 43%.
However, if a number two brand spends between 50 - 70% of its budget on media advertising, it earns its highest possible return (28%); if it spends over 70%, its profitability is likely to be halved (Mitchell, 1987).

Strong brands have a core of loyal customers, thus generating more predictable earning streams. They can also override the occasional hitches and major crises that usually destroy weaker brands.
Companies with strong brands are able to leverage brand values and shift between product categories (such as from Mars chocolate to Mars ice cream, or from Caterpillar earth-moving equipment to shoes and outdoor clothing).

## What is a successful brand?

Take, for example, brands such as Aeroflot, Lada Cars, and Wimpy Restaurants. Many people recognise these brands but do not develop preferences for them.
A classic Landor survey (1989) reported that BT (British Telecom) featured among the UK's top 10 brands in terms of awareness; unfortunately for esteem, it was rated number 300. BT was known for all the wrong reasons. It was a strong, negative brand, a problem that the privatised firm has had to work hard at solving.
Hence, **it is important to distinguish between a known brand and one that is successful.**

A successful brand is one that customers perceive as offering superior value. It therefore enjoys a strong positive image: **it is known for all the right reasons.**.
We can define a successful brand as a name/symbol/design (or combination of all three) that has a sustainable differential advantage. Such brands have a solid reputation for quality, reliability, superiority, value-for-money, or service. Brands such as Coca-Cola, Sony, Toyota, and Apple enjoy a high level of awareness and preference among customers and are perceived as more desirable than similar products from competitors.

Successful brands are invariably brand leaders in their market segment or channel. At the same time, they command prices that sustain a high profit margin. **So successful brands not only enjoy a superior share of the market, they also have stronger profit performance.**

## How are successful brands built?

First, it is important to dispel one myth about successful brands, **which is that a strategy based on lots of advertising creates a strong brand.**
It is true that to achieve a high level of brand awareness in the market, the firm must spend sufficiently on advertising and promoting the brand, but other types of brand support are required to build a strong brand and to distinguish it from competitors' brands.

Building a successful brand **requires four-stage investment strategy:**

1 - **First**: invest in a quality product that meets the functional needs of customers. Quality is the foundation upon which all other brand associations are built. However quality alone is not the deciding factor. Today, competitors quickly copy a product's features and functional attributes, making quality advantages short-lived. Companies must set up barriers to competitive imitation by building a brand that has values that go beyond functionality.

2 - **The second stage** in the investment strategy is to build clear brand features around the product that differentiate the basic brand and add value to enhance its appeal. These include design, choice of brand name, and presentation - advertising messages and promotional efforts that create emotional associations on top of the physical properties of the product.

3 - **The third stage** is building the augmented brand. The basic brand presents the core elements of the product attractively. The augmented brand extends the core product. Mercedes-Benz, Sony and Levi's add to their products personal services, loyalty schemes, money-back guarantees, after-sales service, and financial support. These additional benefits and value enhance the customer's total purchasing and usage experience. With basic brands being increasingly similar in quality, it is in this area of augmentation that much of today's competition occurs.

4 - **Finally** when companies consistently maintain this high level of brand investment over a long period, they achieve the brand's potential. The potential brand is the final defensive barrier built around the product, consisting of added values that are so great, consumers will not switch, no matter how cheap and readily available the alternatives are. Companies such as Coca-Cola, Apple, Kellogg, and BMW have achieved their brand's potential through years of investment in building and maintaining the brand's functional and psychological (hopes, dreams, confidence, esteem) values, ensuring their relevance in a changing enviornment. Consistent investment in advertising and promotions communicates brand values and reinforces brand associations. t is the firm's long-term, strategic investment in product quality, design, advertising, services, customer support, guarantees, and so forth, that builds consumer confidence in its brands. **By contrast, firms that view brand-building expenditure as a cost to be minimised rather than as an investment to be optimised will inevitably end up with weak brands (Doyle, 1994).**

## Added values

Added values are inextricably linked with successful brands. Let us explore how these occur. **There is evidence that customer's buying decisions are influenced by attributes that are supplementary to those based upon functional (quality, performance, product feature) differences between competing products.**

In blind tests, customers often indicate no clear preference for competing products in an unbranded form. However, if a top brand name is attached, customers will not only switch in preference, **but they will also be willing to pay a higher price for it.**

Even in industrial buying situations, studies show that the more powerful the brand name, the greater the chances of the industrial buyer giving the company a hearing for anew product and the greater the likelihood of adoption (Levitt, 1965).

The task of selecting alternative products on purely technical or rational grounds can be difficult, costly, and time-consuming, not least because of the pace of technological change and the bewildering variety and volume of advertising and promotional messages to which buyers are exposed regularly.

Reputable brands give confidence, reduce risks, and simplify the decision for buyers who are looking for safe ways to navigate the jungle of brands. Additionally, brands are frequently bought for emotional reasons, not just for functional benefits.
**Rarely is a Rolex watch bought because the wearer needs to know the time; its purchase makes a personal statement about the owner. Ferrari and Mercedes-Benz are not just means of transport; they conjure up a broad spectrum of lifestyles, hopes and fantasies.**

Added brand values are acquired in several ways. If a brand functions well or delivers good service over years of regular usage, it acquires, through user experience, added values of proven reliability and familiarity. If it performs unsatisfactorily or if customer usage lapses, the brand will not acquire these positive associations due to poor usage.
Brands can be associated with specific types of people. **Pirelli Tyers** successfully used a long-running global advertising campaign to convey images of the product's power and performance by associating the brand with Olympic athlete Carl Lewis.

Brand appearance and design can also be used to convey values such as quality or exclusivity. In some cases, customers 'faith that a brand will work', that is, their belief in its efficacy, created by comparative product ratings, opinion formers, and industry endorsments, generates satisfaction in use and enhances the brand's positive associations.
