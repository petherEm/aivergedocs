# Sustainable Competitive Advantage


**Sustainable Competitive Advantage (SCAs)** pursued by firms result, not from a single element of a marketing strategy but from multiple elements. The value proposition, the assets and competencies possessed and pursued by firms, the choice of markets and competitors, and the functional areas strategies must combine and work together in order for an SCA to be developed and achieved. {{ className: "lead"}}

In addition, the SCAs themselves should possess three characteristics. They should be:{{ className: "lead"}}

1 - Substantial <br />
2 - Sustainable <br />
3 - Leveraged <br />

After all, doing things right to achieve the wrong SCA **is just as innefective as doing things wrong in an effort to achieve the right SCA.** {{ className: "lead"}}

## Dive in

Specifically, SCAs should be **substantial** in the sense that any means to achieve an SCA that would result in only a modest edge over a competitor or provide only a slight increase in perceived differences between the firm and its competitors risks having a negligible impact on the firm's performance. 
<Note>
If a travel services firm's new functional area strategy for pricing its currency exchanges emphasises better exchange rates for large-sum transactions, the strategy may result in a perceived difference among competing firms, but the impact of the strategy may be negligible if, for most customers, the actual amount of money gained amounted to fractions of a percent on a typical transaction.
