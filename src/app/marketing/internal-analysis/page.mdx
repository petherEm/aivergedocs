# Internal Analysis

In conducting a thorough internal analysis of a firm, the firm's internal performance should be analyzed in terms of **profitability, sales, shareholder value, customer satisfaction, product quality, brand associations, relative cost, new product capabilities and performance, and appropriateness of product portfolios.**

In addition, the factors that are influential in determining the company's strategic options must be analysed. These includes past and current strategies, strategic problems, organisational capabilities and constraints, financial resources and constraints, and company strengths and weaknesses.

<Note>
To be sure, the financial performance of a firm always matters. What is less clear, however, is knowing which financial measures matter most. Is it sales, market share or profitability? Aaker and Moorman argue that financial performance may actually be measured best by shareholder value. More specifically, a business earns a return on assets that meet or exceed the cost of capital. At the same time, however, managers must be wary that, in performing such analyses, insufficient priority may be given to the company's human assets (that is, its employees) or even its customers.

BEYOND THE FINANCIALS

It is also useful to examine multiple measures of the company's performance and competitive position by looking beyond the financials. Indetifying the assets and competencies of current strategies - as well as future strategies - can be beneficial in identifying company strengths and weaknesses that can support or hinder a new marketing strategy initiatives.

As part of a comprehensive value chain analysis, where the firm's strategically important activities **are decomposed for critically evaluating their value contribution, it may therefore be highly beneficial to examine such areas as the company's product and service quality, its brand associations, relative costs and level of new product development activity.**

For example, by better understanding the company's **relative costs (whether the firm's products or services are more or less expensive than competitors)** throughout its value chain in combination with an assessment of product quality, the firm can determine whether or not the product's prices should be raised, cost reduction should be promoted, product designs should be changed or upgraded, or simply left as is.

In performing the above analysis, clear, honest and objective perspective are needed and should be sought when talking with employees and when collecting and analysing data. The worst outcome of an internal analysis would be attributing success **to one of the firm's capabilities when it was, in fact, just plain good fortune,** for example, being in the right place at the right time. It is also important to examine the various tactical problems of the company in sufficient depth because there are often strategic implications for tactical problems.

<Note>
  Ultimately, the strategic choices of a firm are shaped by the company's past
  and current strategies, strategic problems, capabilities, constraints,
  strengths and weaknesses. Each company's strategic marketing choices will
  therefore be unique, for example, Dyson's strategic choices to increase
  shareholder value with its vacuum cleaner line are quite different from
  Hoover's as a result of key differences in patented technologies and company
  cost structures.

## Explaining success

A major benefit of performing the preceding analysis is the ability to understand better the key factors led to a company's current level of success.
The question may be asked, **how often is success within any company explained by a single factor? Very very rarely, research suggest.**

Much-respected former WBS professor, **Robin Wensley (1997)**, discusses this point, focusing on market share as a key factor in explaining a firm's success. The bottom line from the article can be summarized in two points:

- **We must be cautious in thinking that any single approach, such as obtaining a high market share, could ever consistently lead to success (high ROI and profitability).**
- **A number of approaches might work together to increase significantly the likelihood of success.**

Thus, it is rare that any single factor within a company's control explains more than 10% of the company's success. High market share combines with low prices, for example, to increase volumen and production experience which, in turn, lowers costs to help increase profits. Success takes hard work - managing multiple factors under the control of the firm and responding appropriately to external factors that are beyond the firm's control.

<Note>
  Analyses of the external and internal marketing environments can help a
  company not only understand why it is or is not successful in its marketing
  strategy, but also effectively disseminate such knowledge within the company
  to help ensure its long-term success.
