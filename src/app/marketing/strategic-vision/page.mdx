# Strategic Vision

In fast-paced, fast-changing markets, it is often easy to get caught up in the rush of day-to-day activities and decision-making.
**What is the one characteristic that distinguishes higher-performing firms from lower-performing ones over the long term?** {{ className: 'lead' }}

- A key characteristic is often the presence of a strategic vision that enables firms to **increase their focus on the future.** {{ className: 'lead' }}
- Strategic visions provide a clear future strategy of exactly what the firm wants to do or where the firm wanst to do or where the firm wants to be. {{ className: 'lead' }}

Thus, when Microsoft entered the gaming market, the strategic vision of Microsoft was not only to be a major player in the video gaming market but also to overtake Sony in the video game consoles and video gaming market. As can be imagined, turning a strategic vision into coordinated action within the firm requires buy-in throughout the entire organisation, where the greater the degree of acceptance among all employees, the more likely the firm will pursue its strategic vision both effectively and efficiently.

## Vision versus opportunism

Strategic vision can be further understood when contrasted with strategic opportunism, where the former strategy involves a focus on the future and latter involves a focus on the present.
Although a strategic vision can serve a firm well, both strategies actually risks associated with their use. With a proper view of the future, a firm pursuing a strategic vision may be rewarded for its foresight but a firm's vision may also be faulty and end up being a big waste of time and money to the firm.

## Strategic Intent

When a firm has a strategic vision along with a commitment to winning at all levels of the organisation, the firm has what **Aaker and McLoughlin (2007)** refer to as **strategic intent.**

Microsoft's strategic intent can be reasily characterized by the view that its long-term intent is to completely dominate the software market.
Tesla's strategic intent is to be a major producer of not just high-end, high-performance and luxury electric automobiles but also readily affordable mass-market electric automobiles.

As a driving force in marketing strategy development and implementation, therefore, the strategic intent of a firm:

- captures the essence of winning, where the firm's employees have developed an obsession for reaching specified goals, such as all deliveries being shipped overnight by an express delivery firm
- is stable over time by limiting tendencies to engage in strategic opportunism
- sets targets that deserve personal effort and commitment
- implies a sizeable stretch as a result of the necessity for all levels and areas of a firm to work together to realise strategic vision

A key conclusion of the above discussion is that, **in order to maximise the output of a strategic vision and the strategic intent of a firm, the firm needs to be managed with sufficient flexibility as well.**
Every firm must attempt to manage its resources commitments to be able to respond to external and internal changes in a timely manner while remaining committed to its strategic vision. Thus, while Toyota's strategic intent for its Lexus automibiles is to maintain a strong reputation for quality and reliability Toyota also ensures a degree of strategic flexibility in its investments in R&D and marketing efforts by maintaining a significant level of financial liquidity within the organization.
