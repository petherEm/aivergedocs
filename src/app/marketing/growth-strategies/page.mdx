# Growth Strategies

The various paths to growth invariably require the firm to have different skills and resources to ensure successful choices.
Managers can increase the likelihood of their firm's successful growth if they are well grounded in five generic growth or product-market investment strategies.
They can thus ensure compatibility and consistency with other elements of the firm's overall marketing strategy. {{ className: 'lead' }}


## Growth in existing product markets

Often the simplest approach for a company's growth strategy is to use its existing products to grow in its present markets. This approach requires no additional investment in product development. However, working to gain market share or trying to increase product usage in order to increase product profitability can be challenging for firms.

Many companies in mature markets try to grow by increasing advertising spend in an effort to capture a few points of market share from competitors. For certain products, a few percentage points of market share can translate into huge profits, as is the case with the UK's laundry detergent market.
However, the effects of advertising are often short-lived. Often, it is potentially more beneficial to find ways to increase the value delivered by fine-tuning other functional area strategies (i.e. not just promotions). Despite the dificulties of increasing product usage, it is undeniable that a firm that successfully do can grow in their existing market.

## Product development

Another strategy that can be pursued independently or in conjunction with the above is growth in the present markets by developing new products.

<Note>
Indeed, companies that do not pursue both strategies simultaneusly will generally not last long.
</Note>

Today's rapid pace of technological innovation requires companies **to continually re-evaluate their current product** offerings in the light of new products introduced by nimble competitors. For example, the manufacturers of portable solid-state storage devices used for secure physical backups of personal computers are being continually forced to offer not just lower prices but devices with ever-increasing capacity, ever-smaller sizes, and increasingly aesthetically pleasing shapes, colours, and styles.

## Market development

Firms choosing to grow by offering their existing products to new markets are often limited only by their imagination (and resources, of course) when it comes to thinking about paths for growth.
Beyond expanding geographically, firms can tartget segments defined in any number of ways. For example, Coca-Cola has found a lucrative segment consisting of univeristies as institutional customers. As a result, the company has made a point to negotiate multi-year contracts with universities that prevent rival colas from being sold on theri campuses in exchange for substantial upfront payments to the universities.

## Vertical integration

Vertical integration is a growth strategy whereby a firm decides to assume ownership of one or more additional stages of its supply chain in which it was not previously involved. It might do this by acquiring a distributor or a source of supply. By acquiring a source of supply, it is effectively closer to the sources of inputs or raw materials.
By acquiring a distributor, it is closer to its end customers.

Whether the firm is integrating vertically as a means of being closer to its customers or to be closer to its suppliers, **vertical integration carries both benefits and risks.**
On the one hand, it can ensure long-term access to certain raw materials or it can gain greater control of how its products are promoted and distributed to its customers.
On the other hand, the strategy can tie the hands of the company and move it into areas in which it is unfamiliar.

Breweries buy pubs to control better how their beers and ales are offered in the pubs. However, if the pub's new brewery-controlled marketing strategy differs from that desired by the tastes of locals, the strategy risks alienating important market segment.

## Diversification

There are many reasons firms may choose to diversify as a path to growth and there are an equally large number of ways in which firms may actually choose to diversify.

Who would have thought McDonald's would diversify into cafes and offer pre-packaged ketchup in supermarkets?
Certainly, the strength of the company's brand and its long experience in offering quality and consistent service are contributors to its decision to make these diversification moves, but what was it that led McDonald's to venture (unsuccessfully) into hotels, opening up the first McDonald's hotel in Zurich?

The company was seeking to take advantage of its appeal to families who were looking for consistency in quality of offering, but the fact that a number of the executives who had joined the McDonald's corporation were from the hotel industry will also have been influential in the company's decision to diversify into hotels.

Unfortunately for McDonald's the diversification move posed too great a challenge and the firm ultimately ended up running an unprofitable business, which it subsequently exited.

## Summary

When pursuing one or more growth strategies, however, the bottom line is that **the strategy should be consistent with the findings of the external and internal analysis performed by the marketing strategy developer and it should provide clear opportunities for purusing sustainable competitive advantages based on the company's assets, competencies, and synergies.**
