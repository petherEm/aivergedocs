# Marketing Myopia

**Marketing Myopia** is a seminal concept introduced by **Theodore Levitt (1960)** in Harvard Business Review article.
Levitt's concept fundamentally challenged **how businesses view their operations and market orientation, advocating for a broader, more visionary approach to understanding customer needs and market dynamics.**

## Core concept

Levitt argued that companies suffer from "marketing myopia" when they focus too narrowly on their own products or immediate market environment rather than on the broader needs of their customers. This **short-sightedness** leads businessess to overlook potential growth opportunities and makes them vulnerable to competitive threats and market changes.

## Key takeaways

- **Product-Oriented vs Customer-Oriented** - Levitt criticized businesses for being too product-oriented, focusing on their products' features and quality while neglecting the actual needs and desires of their customers. He advocated for a shift towards a customer-oriented approach, where understanding and fulfilling customer needs is paramount.

- **The danger of a narrowly defined market** - Companies often define their markets too narrowly, which can lead to a failure to adapt to changes in customer preferences or technological advancements. Levitt suggested that businesses should define their markets in terms of the needs they fulfill, not the products they sell.

- **The importance of innovation** - Levitt emphasized that continous innovation is crucial for businesses to stay relevant and competitive. Companies should focus on how they can evolve to meet changing customer needs rather than merely improving existing products.

- **The concept of obsolence** - Levitt warned that no product is immune to becoming obsolete. The belief in the inevitability of growth within certain industries can lead to complacency. Businesses must be vigiliant and adaptable to prevent obsolence.

## Implications for Businesses

Levitt's Marketing Myopia encourages businesses to:

- **Look beyond their current products and services to understand broader customer needs.**
  Stay adaptable and willing to change their offerings as market conditions and customer preferences evolve.
- **Innovate continually, not just in product development but in all aspects of the business, including delivery, service, and customer engagement.**

## Legacy

The concept of **Marketing Myopia has had a profound and lasting impact on how businesses approach strategic planning and marketing.** It has led to a greater focus on market and customer orientation, emphasizing the importance of looking ahead and thinking strategically about future market dynamics and opportunities.

In essence, **Levitt's work serves as a reminder that businesses must remain focused on the broader landscape of customer needs and be prepared to adapt and innovate constantly to achieve sustainable growth and success.**
